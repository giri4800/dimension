# **App Name**: Dimension Detective

## Core Features:

- Image Input: Provides a user interface for uploading images from the device's photo library or capturing new images using the camera.
- Camera Stream: Display live video stream from device camera.
- Dimension Calculation: Utilizes OpenCV and Python backend to process images or video frames, detect objects, and calculate their dimensions (height and width).
- Dimension Overlay: Overlays the measured dimensions onto the image or video stream, providing users with clear visual feedback.
- Calibration Tool: Allows users to calibrate the system using a reference object of known size (e.g., a ruler or a coin) to ensure accurate measurements.
- Image Export: Enables users to save the processed image with dimension overlays to their device.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark blue (#3F51B5) to give a technological and reliable feel.
- Background color: Very light blue (#E8EAF6). This provides a clean and unobtrusive backdrop.
- Accent color: Purple (#7E57C2) for highlighting measurements and key interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif for a clean and modern aesthetic. It is suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Use clean and simple line icons to represent different functions (upload, camera, save, calibrate).
- Prioritize a clean and intuitive layout, ensuring that key features such as image input, camera stream, and dimension display are easily accessible.
- Incorporate subtle animations during the measurement process and when displaying dimension overlays to provide visual feedback without being distracting.
